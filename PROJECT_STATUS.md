## Development Approach

### 1. Database First
Continue with database-driven development as foundation.

### 2. Backend Before Frontend
Implement data models and APIs before building UI components.

### 3. MVP Focus
Prioritize core features: campaigns, payments, updates, and basic trust scoring.

### 4. Iterative Development
Build in small increments with continuous testing.

## Technical Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. Run the user roles migration
2. Configure social authentication providers
3. Test MFA enrollment and verification flows
4. Create initial admin user via database

### Architecture Decisions:
1. Keep using Supabase for rapid development (Phase 1-2)
2. Use Edge Functions for business logic
3. Implement real-time features with Supabase Realtime
4. Plan for future microservices migration (Phase 3+)

## Enhanced Authentication Features

### Social Login
- Google OAuth integration ready
- Apple OAuth support (requires configuration)
- Automatic user profile creation on signup
- Social provider tracking in database

### Multi-Factor Authentication
- TOTP-based authentication
- QR code generation for easy setup
- Support for all major authenticator apps
- MFA verification during login flow

### Role-Based Access Control
- Four user roles: donor, recipient, admin, superadmin
- Permission-based authorization system
- Role guards for route protection
- Easy-to-use hooks for permission checking

## Resources Needed

### Development Tools:
- Supabase CLI for local development
- Stripe CLI for webhook testing
- Docker for future microservices
- QR code generation library (installed)

### External Services:
- Supabase project (free tier initially)
- Stripe account (test mode)
- SendGrid or similar for emails
- Sentry for error tracking
- Google Cloud Console (for OAuth)
- Apple Developer Account (optional)

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks:
- Test social login thoroughly before production
- Implement MFA recovery options
- Regular security audits on role permissions
- Monitor failed authentication attempts

### Security Considerations:
- Enable RLS on all tables from the start ✅
- Use environment variables for all secrets ✅
- Implement rate limiting on API endpoints
- Regular security audits
- Require MFA for admin accounts

## Success Metrics

Track these metrics during development:
- Database query performance (< 100ms)
- API response times (< 250ms)
- Test coverage (> 80%)
- Security scan results (0 critical issues)
- Authentication success rate (> 95%)
- MFA adoption rate (track over time)

## Next Steps for Developer

1. Run the analytics migrations:
   ```bash
   supabase migration up
   ```
2. Test the analytics dashboard:
   - Navigate to `/campaigns/manage` to see your campaigns
   - Click "Analytics" on any active campaign
   - Verify all tabs and charts are working
   - Test CSV export functionality
3. Run the test script:
   ```bash
   node scripts/test-analytics.js
   ```
4. Continue with Task #22 (Social Sharing Features)
5. Then proceed to Task #9 (Campaign Listing and Browse Pages) if not complete
6. Build payment integration (Task #11)
7. Implement trust score system (Task #14)

## Continuation Prompt

To continue development, use this prompt:
"I need to continue working on the Blessed-Horizon crowdfunding platform. The project root is at `Z:\\.CodingProjects\\GitHub_Repos\\FundRaisingProject`. I've completed Task #21 (Analytics Dashboard) which provides comprehensive analytics for campaign creators including donation trends, traffic analysis, engagement metrics, and financial reporting. Please help me with Task #22 (Social Sharing Features) from the task list. I need to implement social media sharing functionality for campaigns with Open Graph tags, share buttons, and tracking."
