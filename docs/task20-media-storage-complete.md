# Task #20 Complete: Media Storage Configuration

## Summary
Successfully implemented comprehensive media storage system for the FundRaising platform using Supabase Storage with 5 specialized buckets and enterprise-grade security policies.

## Key Achievements

### 1. Storage Buckets Created

- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for each bucket
- Public/private access controls based on content type
- Owner-only write permissions
- Donor access to view receipts for their campaigns

### 3. Storage Service
- Complete TypeScript service with 20+ methods
- File validation (type, size)
- Image optimization and thumbnail generation
- Batch upload support
- Progress tracking
- Signed URL generation for private files

### 4. MediaUploader Component
- Drag-and-drop interface
- Multi-file upload with progress
- File preview gallery
- Real-time validation
- React Dropzone integration

## Files Created/Modified

### Database
- `supabase/migrations/024_media_storage_buckets.sql` - Storage bucket setup and policies

### Services

## Technical Highlights

### Storage Structure
```
bucket/
├── {entity_id}/
│   ├── {timestamp}-{random}-filename.ext
│   └── subfolder/
│       └── files...
```

### Security Features
- Path traversal protection
- MIME type validation
- File size limits per bucket
- Sanitized filenames
- Orphaned file cleanup

### Performance Optimizations
- Client-side image optimization
- Progressive upload for large files
- Intelligent caching
- Batch operations

## Integration Ready

The storage system is now ready to be integrated into:
- Campaign creation wizard (campaign header/gallery)
- Update creation form (photos, videos, receipts)
- User profile settings (avatar upload)
- KYC verification flow (document upload)

## Next Steps

1. Apply migration: `npx supabase migration up`
2. Test uploads in development
3. Configure CORS in Supabase dashboard
4. Integrate MediaUploader into existing forms
5. Set up scheduled cleanup job

## Project Progress
- **33/45 tasks completed** (73% total completion)
- Storage infrastructure complete and ready for media uploads
- All file operations now have secure, scalable backend support

The platform now has enterprise-grade media storage capabilities with comprehensive security and optimal user experience!
