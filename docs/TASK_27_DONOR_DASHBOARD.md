- Loading states with skeletons
- Empty states with CTAs
- Animated transitions using Framer Motion
- Consistent styling with Tailwind CSS

### Integration Points
- Supabase queries with proper joins
- Authentication-based data filtering
- Real-time updates capability (ready for implementation)
- i18n support with translation keys

## Pending Enhancements

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] User authentication required to access dashboard
- [ ] All tabs load without errors
- [ ] Donation history displays correctly
- [ ] Pagination works on history tab
- [ ] Impact metrics calculate accurately
- [ ] Followed campaigns show correct status
- [ ] Updates feed loads recent items
- [ ] Navigation from dashboard to campaigns works
- [ ] Mobile responsive design functions properly
- [ ] Empty states display when no data

## Security Considerations
- RLS policies ensure users only see their own donation data
- No sensitive payment information exposed
- Proper authentication checks on all routes

## Performance Optimizations
- Lazy loading of tab content
- Pagination on large datasets
- Efficient database queries with proper indexes
- Component-level code splitting ready

## Dependencies
- React Router for navigation
- Framer Motion for animations
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Lucide React for icons
- Shadcn/ui components
- i18next for translations

## Next Steps
1. Implement export functionality (Task #30)
2. Add real-time update subscriptions
3. Enhance with advanced analytics (Task #29)
4. Integrate with push notifications (Task #26 completed)
